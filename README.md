# Peoples Wifi Mesh Node Admin #

This is our stripped down admin for people's wifi mesh nodes. Currently it allows for editing all wifi configurations, changing the admin password, and adjusting bandwidth sharing. 

I've updated the authentication to (hopefully) support both a full admin user and a mini-admin user whom would only be able to make basic changes. In order to make use of the stripped down admin, an "admin" account has to be added to the AP.
