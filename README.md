Peoples Wifi Mesh Node Admin
===============
This is our stripped down admin for people's wifi mesh nodes. Currently it allows for editing all wifi configurations and changing the admin password. 

The authentication scheme still needs serious work - right now all we have is http basic auth and the username and password are stored in the code repo.
