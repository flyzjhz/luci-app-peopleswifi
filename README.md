Peoples Wifi Mesh Node Admin
===============
This is our stripped down admin for people's wifi mesh nodes. Currently it allows for editing all wifi configurations and changing the admin password. 

I've updated the authentication to (hopefully) support both a full admin user and a mini-admin user whom would only be able to make basic changes. Currently the mini-user username:password is set to "homeuser":"homeuser"
